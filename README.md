# My Shop

This project is a dummy e-commerce store created using express.js and the data is rendered dynamically using the teplating engine ejs
The major features of the project are:
  - Creation of Products
  - Updation of Products
  - Deletion of Products
  - Adding them into Cart
  - Deletion of cart items

(I have not implemented the logic of displaying total price on the cart page, so anyone can contribute to the project)

This project uses file system approach to store the data of the products and the cart details. Since this is not the most preferred way to store data, I will be using a different approach in the next version of this project:)
